# Architecture and Components

Arvin is a lending platform that utilizes interest-bearing tokens (ibTKNs) as collateral to access a USD-pegged stablecoin called Magic Internet Money (IN). IN can be used just like any other conventional stablecoin. In the current landscape, there are numerous assets, like yVaults, that have capital locked in without the ability to be utilized further. Arvin presents an opportunity to leverage these assets and put them to productive use.
