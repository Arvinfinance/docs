The presence of risky long-tail assets does not necessarily imply that they lack the potential for significant future growth. It can be frustrating for individuals holding these assets to be unable to enhance their returns through additional DeFi strategies. Evaluating risk in relation to potential returns is a fundamental principle. In line with this, Arvin will gradually incorporate support for more long-tail assets as collateral.

However, it's important to note that as the inclusion of these assets expands, the corresponding interest rates and borrowing fees will be adjusted accordingly. This adjustment benefits the protocol by generating more revenue, while simultaneously providing borrowers with an opportunity to enhance their capital efficiency. This approach fosters a mutually beneficial outcome, creating a win-win situation for all stakeholders involved.
