# Isolated Lending Markets

In the world of DeFi, isolated lending markets are crucial due to the inherent risk associated with relying on a single collateral. A black-swan event affecting one collateral can lead to significant risks and bad debt for the entire protocol.

To address this challenge, Arvin introduces isolated lending markets with distinct caps for various types of collateral. These lending markets are controlled by the DAO, ensuring that risks are contained within each specific market. This means that any risks or adverse events in one lending market will remain isolated and not impact other lending markets.

By implementing isolated lending markets, Arvin enhances risk management and safeguards the overall stability of the protocol. It allows for greater resilience and protects users' assets by minimizing the potential contagion effects that can occur in a unified lending market.
