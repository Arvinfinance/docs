# Key support for LSD assets

Following the Ethereum Shapella update, the growth potential of LSD assets is expected to accelerate significantly. However, the current market lacks an adequate number of lending products for these assets, resulting in limited composability. This lack of composability hinders users from effectively improving their capital efficiency.

Recognizing this challenge, Arvin is committed to providing key support for LSD assets. Arvin's focus lies in facilitating a more composable ecosystem for lending these assets, akin to interlocking Lego blocks. By enabling greater composability, Arvin aims to enhance the capital efficiency of users engaging with LSD assets.
