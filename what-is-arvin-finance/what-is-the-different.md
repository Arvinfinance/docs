# What is the different?

\
What sets Arvin apart from others? Arvin offers a range of unique features that distinguish it from other platforms:

1. **Expanded asset support**: Arvin supports a diverse selection of assets, including blue-chip assets from Arbitrum (such as ARB, GMX, MAGIC), LSD assets, and IBTs. This broader asset coverage enables users to access a wider range of investment options.
2. **Lower interest rates**: Arvin strives to provide borrowers with more affordable borrowing costs. By offering lower interest rates, Arvin aims to make borrowing more accessible and cost-effective for users.
3. **Fixed interest rate**: Arvin ensures that interest costs remain under control and predictable. Users can benefit from a fixed interest rate, allowing them to better manage and plan their financial commitments.
4. **Higher collateral rate**: Arvin enhances capital efficiency by enabling borrowers to provide a higher collateral rate. This allows users to maximize their borrowing capacity and unlock additional value from their assets.
5. **Reduced liquidation fees**: Arvin minimizes the risk of liquidation for borrowers, particularly during market downturns. By lowering liquidation fees, Arvin aims to provide borrowers with greater protection against rapid market declines.
6. **Lower borrowing fees**: Arvin aims to lower borrowing costs for users, making it more cost-effective to participate in the platform's borrowing services.
7. **True yield rewards**: Arvin's protocol generates revenue that is distributed to users who stake utility tokens ($VIN). Stablecoin holders ($IN) can earn these rewards, promoting a sustainable and rewarding ecosystem for participants.
8. **Community autonomy**: Arvin is built on the principles of fairness and user empowerment. The platform is governed by the Arvin DAO, which ensures a fair launch and community-driven decision-making. Users have a say in shaping the platform's direction and governance.
