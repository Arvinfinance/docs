# Tokenomic

As a fair launch project, the Arvin team is committed to aligning with users through their initial token holdings. The VIN token, which represents utility within the protocol, is subject to a vesting period of four years, with a one-year cliff. This ensures that the team prioritizes the long-term development interests of Arvin Finance.

**Token Details:**

1. VIN (Utility Token): VIN is a utility token designed to promote the development of the protocol. It provides bonus and discount rights that unlock advanced features in the future. By staking VIN, users can earn emissions of governance tokens.

* Contract: Arbitrum

**How to Obtain VIN:**

* Become a liquidity provider
* Purchase VIN on decentralized exchanges
* Be an early adopter

* LP Incentives: Emissions incentivize liquidity providers for tokens associated with the protocol.
* Community: Airdrops for DeFi veteran users, ecological user airdrops, core contributor incentives, and interest subsidies for initial borrowing users.
* Team: Vesting over four years, with a one-year cliff. 25% of the team's share is locked in a 16-week contract.
* DAO Treasury: Used for protocol governance token swaps, maintaining the peg of stablecoin, participating in liquidation, external investments, and expanding protocol assets and influence.

**VIN Emission:**

* Early VIN Adoption: Fixed emissions incentivize liquidity providers during the early adoption phase.
* Liquidity Providers: Fixed daily emission of 400 VINs for a period of 180 days.
* Early Adopters (Borrowers): Variable daily emissions based on collateral type.

**Staking and Vesting:**

* Staked VIN: Receives 50% of protocol revenues, including interest revenue, liquidation fees, and borrowing fees, which are distributed in stablecoin IN.
* Staked VIN also earns additional emissions from the governance token ARV.
* Vesting using VIN incentivizes borrowers and has a 21-day lock-up period, unlocking all at once.

**ARV (Governance Token):**

ARV serves as the governance token for Arvin Finance, granting holders governance rights over the protocol and ownership of the protocol Treasury. ARV holders can create and vote on proposals, with proposers requiring at least 0.5% of ARV to submit a proposal.

* Total Supply: 100,000 tokens
* Emission Rules: Daily emission decreases gradually according to the formula specified.
* ARV can be obtained by staking VIN for a 16-week period to receive emissions.

**IN (Stablecoin):**

IN is a stablecoin pegged to the USD and fully backed by over-collateralized assets.

These token dynamics contribute to the health and balance of Arvin Finance, incentivizing users and fostering community participation.
