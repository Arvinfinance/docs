# One-click leverage

To enhance users' ability to leverage their positions on high-quality interest-bearing assets, we have developed an intuitive one-click leverage function. This feature empowers users to select their desired leverage level effortlessly. Within the user interface (UI), the system automatically calculates essential parameters such as the liquidation price and debt status. This streamlines the process, allowing users to easily determine and employ the optimal leverage level that aligns with their unique financial situation.

Additionally, we introduce $GLP as the LP token of GMX, a decentralized perpetual exchange. $GLP has proven to be a stable and highly sought-after investment on Arbitrum, generating consistent and attractive APY returns. Our focus is on offering $GLP investors a secure, low-interest, and user-friendly leverage product that maximizes their income potential.
